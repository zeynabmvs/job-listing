## Overview

### The challenge

Users should be able to:

- Filter job listings based on the selected categories.
- View the optimal layout for the interface depending on their device's screen size.
- See hover and focus states for all interactive elements on the page.

We used the provided `data.json` file to populate the content dynamically on the first load.
